A Z-Wave dashboard that let's you control and configure Z-Wave devices.
It has a configurable main screen that shows Z-Wave values directly and in a trend.
It is a Microsoft UWP app that uses openZWave, it's ZWave connection is made through a Aeotec Gen5 Z-Wave USB Z-Stick (other sticks should also work)

Its purpose is to control Z-wave devices and act as a data gateway. 
Values are stored in an SQLite database and when internet is available it sends to a receiver using web sockets.
The web socketâ€™s part is working but not thoroughly tested, I stopped maintaining this project. Still, it works fine, nice and stable as a Z-wave controller.

I ran this on a Raspberry 3 with Windows 10 IOT core. As a UWP app it also runs perfectly on Windows 10 and 11. 
The application is touch screen enabled. I used a 7" 720p screen with a AliExpress housing.

When selecting an item their data is shown in a touch friendly trend viewer.

Adding items to the main screen is done through this screen, selecting a + sign brings a small config screen for naming and optional data manipulation like multiplication. The 3 lines open this config screen again.
